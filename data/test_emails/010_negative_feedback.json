  "body": "Hi TaskFlow,\n\nI've been a loyal customer for 2 years, but I'm really disappointed with the recent UI redesign.\n\nThe new interface is confusing and slower than before. Features I used daily are now buried in menus. The mobile app is especially bad - it takes 3 more clicks to create a task now.\n\nSeveral colleagues have mentioned switching to competitors. We liked the old version better.\n\nCan you provide an option to use the classic interface? Or at least explain the reasoning behind these changes?\n\nI hope you'll listen to user feedback.\n\nRegards,\nRachel Green\nFreelance Designer"
