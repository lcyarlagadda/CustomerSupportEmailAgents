  "body": "Hi,\n\nI just wanted to share some positive feedback. We've been using TaskFlow Pro for our entire department (50+ users) for the past 6 months, and it's been fantastic.\n\nThe interface is intuitive, the mobile app works great, and the customer support has been excellent. We've had a few questions along the way and your team has always been quick to respond.\n\nWe're recommending TaskFlow to other departments in our company.\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Brown\nIT Manager"
